### Introduction
景记是一款发布高质量旅游散文的app

<b>ToSee</b> is an app for travellers. You can write travel notes and share wonderful photos in this app. We also provide <b>social module</b> so you can follow any travellers you like. There are different <b>categories</b>、verious <b>columns</b>、 <b>recommended algorithm</b> and <b>timeline</b> for article reviewing in this app. This app has used Fragment and BottomNavigationBar for framework, using OKHttp for internet request and spring restTemplate for client. And I have also designed an easy-work time-line ui. The functions in this app are much similar to <a href="www.jianshu.com/app">Jianshu</a>
